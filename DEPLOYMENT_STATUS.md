# üöÄ Deployment Status - Synter AI AdWords Dashboard

## ‚úÖ Code Ready for Deployment

### What's Completed:
- [x] BigQuery integration for multi-platform ad data
- [x] Dashboard API routes updated to query BigQuery
- [x] D3.js charts connected to live data
- [x] Multi-platform support (Google, Reddit, Microsoft, LinkedIn)
- [x] Fallback to mock data when BigQuery unavailable
- [x] Railway configuration files ready
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/jshorwitz/ai-adwords

## üîß Manual Deployment Steps

Since the Railway CLI is having service connection issues, here's how to deploy manually:

### Option 1: Railway Web Dashboard

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/
2. **Create New Project** or select existing "astonishing-reflection"
3. **Connect GitHub**: Link to https://github.com/jshorwitz/ai-adwords
4. **Configure Service**:
   - Build Command: Auto-detected (Nixpacks)
   - Start Command: `python app_safe.py`
   - Health Check: `/health`
5. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - See RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for full list
   - Most importantly: PORT=8000, HOST=0.0.0.0

### Option 2: Railway CLI (when working)

```bash
railway login
railway link  # Link to existing project
railway up    # Deploy from current directory
```

## üìä Expected Features After Deployment

### Dashboard Features:
- **Multi-platform KPIs**: Total spend, impressions, clicks, conversions
- **8 D3.js Charts**: 
  - Spend distribution donut chart
  - ROAS comparison bars
  - Conversions by platform
  - Impressions volume
  - Cost per conversion
  - Click-through rates
  - Performance bubble chart
  - 30-day time series trends

### Data Sources:
- **Google Ads**: Campaign performance data
- **Reddit Ads**: Mock/real data based on API setup
- **Microsoft Ads**: Mock/real data with OAuth connection
- **LinkedIn Ads**: Mock data (can be upgraded to real)

### BigQuery Integration:
- **Tables Created**:
  - `campaigns_performance` (Google Ads)
  - `keywords_performance` (Keyword data)  
  - `ad_metrics` (Multi-platform unified schema)

## üîç Testing the Deployment

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

1. **Homepage**: `https://web-production-97620.up.railway.app/`
2. **Dashboard**: `https://web-production-97620.up.railway.app/dashboard`
3. **Health Check**: `https://web-production-97620.up.railway.app/health`
4. **API Status**: `https://web-production-97620.up.railway.app/api`
5. **KPI Data**: `https://web-production-97620.up.railway.app/dashboard/kpis`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If App Shows 404:
- Check Railway deployment logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure start command is `python app_safe.py`

### If Charts Show Mock Data:
- Set BigQuery environment variables
- Upload service account JSON
- Run `python -m src.cli setup-bigquery` to create tables

### If Authentication Issues:
- Check DATABASE_URL is set by Railway PostgreSQL addon
- Verify JWT_SECRET_KEY is generated

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Complete Railway deployment** via web dashboard
2. **Set up BigQuery** environment variables  
3. **Test all dashboard features**
4. **Configure real API keys** for live data
5. **Monitor performance** and BigQuery usage
