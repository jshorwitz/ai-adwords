# Google Ads AI Application Specification

## Overview
An intelligent application that connects to Google Ads APIs to monitor ad performance, make automated optimizations, and deliver regular performance reports.

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **API Integration Layer**
   - Google Ads API client
   - Authentication & credential management
   - Rate limiting and error handling

2. **Performance Monitor**
   - Real-time metrics collection
   - Performance threshold detection
   - Anomaly detection algorithms

3. **Optimization Engine**
   - Rule-based optimization strategies
   - AI-driven bid adjustments
   - Keyword performance analysis
   - Ad copy A/B testing automation

4. **Reporting System**
   - Automated report generation
   - Multi-format export (PDF, CSV, JSON)
   - Email/Slack notifications
   - Custom dashboards

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for analytics data
- **APIs**: Google Ads API v14
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0
- **Scheduling**: Node-cron for automated tasks
- **Reporting**: Chart.js for visualizations

## Data Models

### Campaign Performance
```typescript
interface CampaignPerformance {
  campaignId: string;
  name: string;
  status: string;
  impressions: number;
  clicks: number;
  cost: number;
  conversions: number;
  ctr: number;
  cpc: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Optimization Rule
```typescript
interface OptimizationRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'bid_adjustment' | 'keyword_management' | 'budget_allocation';
  conditions: Condition[];
  actions: Action[];
  enabled: boolean;
}
```

## Security Considerations
- OAuth 2.0 token secure storage
- API key encryption
- Rate limiting compliance
- Audit logging for all automated changes
- User permission controls

## Deployment
- Docker containerization
- Environment-based configuration
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Production monitoring and alerting

## Success Metrics
- API response times < 2s
- 99.9% uptime for monitoring
- Automated optimization accuracy > 85%
- Report generation time < 30s
